                             #Key Notes
#Given an array S consisting of N strings. Every string is of the same length M.
#find a pair of strings in array S such that there exists a position in which both of the strings have the same letter. Both the index in array S and the positions in the strings are numbered from zero.
#result should be represented as an array containing three integers. 
#Assumptions:
         #N is an integer within the range [1..30,000];
         #M is an integer within the range [1..2,000];
         #each element of S consists only of lowercase English letters (a-z);
         #N*Mâ‰¤ 30,000.
